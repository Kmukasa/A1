            <div class="bio">
            <p>
                I come from Kampala Uganda, a city in eastern Africa.
                I attended boarding school in a small town in Kenya where I spent the
                first 9 years of my primary and secondary education. I then went on to study
                IB in Eswatini. Pretty random right! I attended a United World College, if you
                don't know what that is its pretty cool I suggest you google it. My years in 
                Eswatini were some of the best and worst years of my life. I'm now at Tufts University, 
                pursuing a bachelor of science in computer science. At Tufts, I spend most of
                my time coding in Halligan, dancing with my team or planning an event with the 
                international club.
